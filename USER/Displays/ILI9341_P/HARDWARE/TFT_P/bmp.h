/*  Raster files of the selected fonts and any graphic ikon data in BMP format    *
*    By Selcuk Ozbayraktar        -  June 2018                                    *
*                                                                                 *
* Developed to use as a scalable resource of Fonts and images                     *
* Image size can be any number of rows x columns. Rows need to be in multiples of *
* bytes. No header or info bytes at the beginning of each new image/font/icon     *
*                                                                                 *
* When referencing any char/icon in this file use "pBmpFile" pointer to this file *
* and offset of its location in the file                                          *
*                                                                                 *
* You may need a raster to hex converter tool. I used a simple excel table with   *
* some macros.                                                                    *
*                                                                                 *
* comments at the end of each line gives the Graphic and ,its Offset in this file *
